## Performed tasks

François and Amandine finished the __Load button__ and its handler. It is now possible to resume a game just by clicking the corresponding button.

François also wrote the README file. This file explains the project and how to play the game.

Valentin worked on the __maven wrapper__. It is now possible to run the project from this, and even generate a JAR file.
