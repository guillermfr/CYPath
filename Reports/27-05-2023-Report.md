## Performed tasks

François and Amandine finished the __Load button__ and its handler. It is now possible to resume a game just by clicking the corresponding button.

François also wrote the README file. This file explains the project and how to play the game.

Valentin re-generated the __Maven Wrapper__ and edited the pom.xml to be able to generate a JAR file. It is now possible to run the project from the generated JAR file, or just with the wrapper and the source code.
