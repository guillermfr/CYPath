## Performed tasks

Line did the __clickable grid__ and continued the __User Interface__ with Amandine.

Amandine -

Valentin finished isMoveValid by creating dedicated methods (isDiagonalMoveValid, isJumpingMoveValid, checkAllRegularMoves).
He also did __placeBarrier__ and __isBarrierValid__ by using Francois' __DFS__ made yesterday. He changed __checkNoBarriers__ to __checkBarrier__ to avoid always inverting it in this method.
He created the new method __checkDistance__ in Position used in __isBarrierValid__.
