## Performed tasks

Valentin started the barrier placement by creating a new EventHandler. He added a goToNextTurn method to remove the handlers and reset other variables for the next player. He encountered a problem where players had to double-click to place barriers the first time but eventually got rid of it.
With Line, they finished the barrier placement and added _ghost players_. They are transparent players on every player turn showing where the player can go. They are shown by checking if the move is valid in every possible position in a radius of 2 around the player.
They also added _ghost barriers_ which are the same for barriers.
Valentin later added a red color to ghost barriers if trying to click while the ghost is not on a valid position.
