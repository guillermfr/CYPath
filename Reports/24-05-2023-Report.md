## Performed tasks

Valentin started the __barrier placement__ by creating a new EventHandler. He added a __goToNextTurn__ method to remove the handlers and reset other variables for the next player. He encountered a problem where players had to double-click to place barriers the first time but eventually got rid of it.
With Line, they finished the barrier placement and added _ghost players_. They are transparent players on every player turn showing where the player can go. They are shown by checking if the move is valid in every possible position in a radius of 2 around the player.
They also added _ghost barriers_ which are the same for barriers.
Valentin later added a red color to ghost barriers if trying to click while the ghost is not on a valid position.

Amandine has redone every __UML diagram__. They are now more detailed and are more in line with our project.

François and Amandine added __Javadoc comments__ and __simple comments__ on every file of the project.

François created an isolated FXML file for the __top left arrow__ that redirects the user to the Home scene, with its own controller. With this, we can simply import it everytime we need it, and having a separated controller is helpful. Indeed we had troubles to figure out how to use multiple controllers in the same file.
He also began to rework the __Continue menu__. In this menu, we should be able to resume a game or delete it. He almost finished the delete button and the resume button will be done when the save system will be ready.
