## Performed tasks

Amandine and Line worked on the __User Interface__ with __Figma__. They created every scenes that we'll need to create. This can be visualised in the __UserInterface__ folder.

Fran√ßois worked on the edge __weighted graph__. It is now possible to initialize the graph with a predetermined size. It will automatically create every necessary edges. He also added Javadoc comments and exceptions management to the Position, Edge and EdgeWeightedGraph classes.

Valentin worked on the __Game__ and __Player__ classes. He added the method checkVictory to check if a player has won the game. He began to work on the player's movement. Before the player can play, we need to check if the move he wants to do is valid, i.e. check if he can jump over another player or if he needs to do a diagonal move to avoid a barrier. There is still work to do on the methods that manage the movement, but it's on the right track. He also created exceptions and an enumeration for directions.
