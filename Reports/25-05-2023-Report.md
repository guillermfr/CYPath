## Performed tasks

Fran√ßois and Amandine worked on the __save button__. When we click on the button and if the game has never been saved, a dialog pane opens and the user can write the name of the file. Then, if the button is clicked again, it will automatically save the game in the same file. So it's possible to save multiple games and see them appear on the continue scene.

Valentin handled the event in which the maximum amount of barriers is reached: the place a barrier button is greyed out and no player can longer click on it. He also fixed a bug where ghost barriers could persist even after a barrier is placed, if unusual mouse actions happen.

Line fixed an issue with the resizing of the game screen. Now, the board will stay at the center of the screen even when resized.
