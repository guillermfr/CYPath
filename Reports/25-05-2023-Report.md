Fran√ßois and Amandine worked on the __save button__. When we click on the button and if the game has never been saved, a dialog pane opens and the user can write the name of the file. Then, if the button is clicked again, it will automatically save the game in the same file. So it's possible to save multiple games and see them appear on the continue scene.
