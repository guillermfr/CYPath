## Performed tasks

Valentin did the victory screen by greying out the barrier placement button, removing the ghost players, preventing the players from moving and announcing the winner at the top of the screen.
He fixed the boxes going out of the pane. They previously had this behaviour because it was calculated once, and when displayed would all take the same size, rounded. This led to big gaps at the end of the game board.
Instead, their size are now calculated once with decimals (supposed size), and for every cell we add, we calculate the difference between the current x or y and the supposed size to fill any missing pixel.
He also created a logo and an icon for the project and applied it. He changed the cursor to be a pointing hand on buttons and ghosts.

Amandine created a separate FXML file for the load button on the _board scene_, with its own controller. This button redirects the user to the _continue scene_.
