## Performed tasks

Every member of the group worked together to create a basis for the project. We created the packages and classes we needed to start the project.

The graph is almost ready to be used. We still need to add the initialization, i.e. dynamically creating every edge, and a way to display the graph in the console, so that we can do tests.

When every basic classes will be ready, we will need to add documentation with __JavaDoc__.
