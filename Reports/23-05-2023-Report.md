## Performed tasks

Fran√ßois and Valentin mainly worked on the __User Interface__. They did the initialization of the graphic board, the display of labels for the players's turn and the turn count and the movement of the players. They began by handling buttons to choose the number of players in the game, and initialize the board according to this number. Then, they managed labels for the player's turn and the turn count so that they automatically update. Finally, for the movement of the players, we do an action whenever the mouse is clicked on the board: we convert the position of the mouse from pixels to values that we can use in our graph, check if the move is possible and if it is, we update the player's position.

Valentin fixed check errors there was in the isMoveValid method and added the switch between moving a player and placing a barrier. He also did the players taking turns and started the barrier placement.
