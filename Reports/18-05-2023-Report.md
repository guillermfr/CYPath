## Performed tasks

Amandine and Line began the __User Interface__ with the __Scene Builder__ but had some problems with it so they couldn't really use it.

Fran√ßois added 2 methods to the __Position__ class. These methods allow to get the neighbours of a Position. It can either get the Positions connected to the selected Position, or the Edges connected to the selected Position. He also made a __Depth First Search__ method in the __EdgeWeightedGraph__ class. This method is useful to check if a player can still reach the side he needs to go to after a barrier has been placed.

Valentin continued to work on the __isMoveValid__ method. He didn't find a _clean_ way to check if a move is valid, so he needs to check every possible move. There are not that much, but we need to take into account each of them, so we need to be careful and be sure that every possible move is checked.
