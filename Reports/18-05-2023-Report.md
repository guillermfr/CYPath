## Performed tasks

Amandine and Line began the __User Interface__ with the __Scene Builder__ but had some problems with it so they couldn't really use it.

Fran√ßois added 2 methods to the __Position__ class. These methods allow to get the neighbours of a Position. It can either get the Positions connected to the selected Position, or the Edges connected to the selected Position. He also made a __Depth First Search__ method in the __EdgeWeightedGraph__ class. This method is useful to check if a player can still reach the side he needs to go to after a barrier has been placed.

Valentin continued to work on the __isMoveValid__ method and finished it. He initially didn't find a _clean_ way to check if a move is valid, but he ended up creating functions to check if diagonal moves, _jumping_ moves and regular moves were valid. It was made by looping through a list of offsets associated to each cardinal direction. For a specific move, each condition to do this move and barriers that should be encountered or not are checked.
