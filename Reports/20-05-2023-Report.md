## Performed tasks

Amandine worked on the serialization. This will be useful to save a game and restore it to play it later. She also worked a bit on the __User Interface__.

Line worked on the __User Interface__ with Valentin. They worked on the __Scene__ for the game itself. We had trouble with the size of the things displayed on the screen. Indeed, when we resize the window, the display is no longer good. So we will need to fix that.

Valentin also updated the __barrier placement method__. Now it adds the barrier to a list and he also added missing checks.

Fran√ßois worked on the __User Interface__, particularly on the __Menu__. He did the __Home__ and __New Game__ scenes, and began the __Continue__ scene. He also began the __Controller__ for the buttons. This __Controller__ allows the user to browse between scenes.
