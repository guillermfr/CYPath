# Java Project : CY Path

## Presentation

This project is a reproduction of the game Quoridor. This game is a 2 or 4 players game where you need to reach the other side of the board with your pawn. To do this, you can either move your pawn one square, or place a barrier to slow the progression of your opponent. This project is developed in Java.
